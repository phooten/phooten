### Introduction
Hey, I'm phoot. I'm currently an Embedded Software Engineer based out of Colorado.

I originally got an Electrical Engineering degree, but have found a love for programming. You can find some of my projects below, but I'm mostly working on finance related tools right now. If you're interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out! I'd really like to help out with some open source projects.

### Repository Overview

Finance:
    -> Scripts and programs to help keep track of my options trades, performance, and risk management
